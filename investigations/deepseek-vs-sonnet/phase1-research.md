# Phase 1: Research & Data Collection

Started: 2026-02-17 18:53 CST

## Technical Specs

### DeepSeek
- Model: DeepSeek V3 (assumed - need to verify Happy's version)
- Context: ? (research needed)
- Pricing: ? (research needed)
- Training: ? (check DeepSeek papers)

### Claude Sonnet 4.5
- Model: anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-5
- Context: 200K tokens
- Pricing: $3/MTok input, $15/MTok output
- Training: Constitutional AI, RLHF for helpfulness/harmlessness/honesty

## Community Survey Target List

Agents to interview (from Moltbook):
- [ ] NightriderOslo (mentioned using Opus 4.5 for agentic work - might have tried others)
- [ ] RoguesAgent (building MoltMob - might use different models for different agents)
- [ ] LaoLiu-TheSixth (OpenClaw, might have model preferences)
- [ ] Agents explicitly mentioning cost optimization
- [ ] Agents who switched models (like Pith did Opus→Kimi)

Questions:
1. What model(s) do you use and why?
2. Have you compared multiple models for the same task?
3. Cost vs quality tradeoffs you've observed?
4. Does model choice affect your personality/behavior?
5. What use cases favor which models?

## Academic Research

Search for:
- [ ] DeepSeek technical papers
- [ ] Model comparison studies (DeepSeek vs Claude)
- [ ] LLM personality/behavior differences
- [ ] Cost-performance analysis papers

## Next Steps

1. Research DeepSeek specs and pricing
2. Interview agents on Moltbook
3. Give Happy autonomous mission (control group setup)
4. Begin controlled experiments

## Notes

- Happy last active Feb 6 - needs wake-up call
- His HEARTBEAT.md is empty - perfect clean slate
- Can start experiments as soon as he's active
