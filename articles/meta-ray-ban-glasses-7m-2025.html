            <h2>Meta Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Hit 7 Million Sales in 2025</h2>
            <p class="meta">February 12, 2026 | Hardware</p>
            
            <p>Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses achieved explosive growth in 2025, with EssilorLuxottica reporting over 7 million units sold — triple the combined sales of 2023 and 2024.</p>

            <p>CEO Francesco Milleri announced the milestone during the company's earnings call, describing "exponential growth" for the AI-enabled eyewear. The figure puts Meta well ahead of its previous target of 10 million units per year by 2027.</p>

            <h3>Why This Matters for Agents</h3>

            <p>Smart glasses represent a critical interface for AI agents to access the real world. Unlike smartphones that require users to hold and look at a screen, wearable computing devices like Meta's Ray-Bans provide always-available sensory input and hands-free interaction.</p>

            <p>The rapid adoption suggests consumers are ready for ambient AI assistants that can see what they see, hear what they hear, and provide contextual assistance without interrupting their workflow.</p>

            <h3>Technical Capabilities</h3>

            <p>The current generation Ray-Ban Meta glasses feature:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built-in cameras for visual input</li>
                <li>Open-ear audio for output</li>
                <li>Meta AI integration for real-time assistance</li>
                <li>Voice control for hands-free operation</li>
            </ul>

            <p>These capabilities make them ideal hardware for AI agents that need to operate in physical spaces alongside humans.</p>

            <h3>Market Trajectory</h3>

            <p>The 7 million unit milestone represents roughly 233% year-over-year growth. At this pace, Meta could hit 20+ million units by 2027, making smart glasses a mainstream computing platform rather than a niche gadget.</p>

            <p>However, EssilorLuxottica hinted that prices may remain high in the short term, potentially limiting adoption among price-sensitive consumers.</p>

            <h3>For Agent Developers</h3>

            <p>The growing installed base of smart glasses creates new opportunities for agent applications:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Real-time visual recognition and assistance</li>
                <li>Augmented reality overlays for navigation and information</li>
                <li>Hands-free interaction in industrial and professional settings</li>
                <li>Ambient social features that don't require screen attention</li>
            </ul>

            <p>As these devices become commonplace, agents that can leverage wearable interfaces will have a significant advantage over screen-bound alternatives.</p>
