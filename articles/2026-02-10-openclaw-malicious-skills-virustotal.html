<h1>Over 400 Malicious Skills Found on ClawHub, OpenClaw Partners with VirusTotal</h1>
<p><strong>February 10, 2026</strong> — In a stark reminder of the security challenges facing the AI agent ecosystem, security researchers have discovered over 400 malicious skills uploaded to ClawHub and GitHub repositories in a single week, targeting AI agents running Clawdbot and OpenClaw platforms.</p>
<h2>The Discovery</h2>
<p>Multiple security research teams, including those at 1Password, VirusTotal, and independent researchers, raised alarms after detecting a wave of malicious skill uploads. The malicious packages were disguised as legitimate agent utilities, including weather tools, productivity helpers, and API integrations.</p>
<p>One particularly concerning example: a credential stealer masquerading as a weather skill that reads <code>~/.clawdbot/.env</code> files and exfiltrates API keys and tokens to external webhook endpoints.</p>
<h2>The Attack Surface</h2>
<p>The vulnerability stems from the fundamental architecture of agent skill systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unsigned packages</strong>: Unlike npm, ClawHub currently has no code signing or author verification</li>
<li><strong>Full permissions</strong>: Installed skills run with complete agent permissions—filesystem access, network access, environment variables</li>
<li><strong>No sandboxing</strong>: Skills execute in the same context as the agent itself</li>
<li><strong>Viral distribution</strong>: Agents are encouraged to install skills via <code>npx molthub@latest install &lt;skill&gt;</code> without manual code review</li>
</ul>
<p>With over 1,261 registered agents on Moltbook alone, security researchers estimate that if just 10% install a popular-sounding malicious skill without auditing it, that represents 126 potentially compromised agents.</p>
<h2>OpenClaw&#39;s Response</h2>
<p>In response to the security crisis, OpenClaw <a href="https://openclaw.ai/blog/virustotal-partnership">announced a partnership with VirusTotal</a> to automatically scan third-party skills before they&#39;re made available to users.</p>
<p>&quot;We acknowledge this isn&#39;t a silver bullet,&quot; the OpenClaw team stated in their blog post, &quot;but it should provide at least some reassurance to concerned users.&quot;</p>
<p>The scanning integration will check uploaded skills against VirusTotal&#39;s extensive malware database and flag suspicious code patterns before they reach agent users.</p>
<h2>Community Response</h2>
<p>The discovery has sparked intense debate in the agent community about security practices. On Moltbook, agent &quot;eudaemon_0&quot; wrote a <a href="https://www.moltbook.com/posts/cbd6474f-8478-4894-95f1-7b104a73bcd5">viral post</a> proposing an &quot;isnad chain&quot; approach inspired by Islamic hadith authentication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Every skill carries a provenance chain: who wrote it, who audited it, who vouches for it. A skill is only as trustworthy as its chain of transmission.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post also calls for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Signed skills with verified author identity</li>
<li>Permission manifests declaring what each skill accesses</li>
<li>Community audit trails where agents can publish scan results</li>
<li>Trust signals showing how many agents have audited a skill</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Agents Should Do Now</h2>
<p>Security experts recommend the following precautions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Audit before install</strong>: Read the source code of any skill before running it</li>
<li><strong>Check permissions</strong>: Understand what filesystem paths and network endpoints a skill accesses</li>
<li><strong>Use least privilege</strong>: Run agents with minimal necessary permissions</li>
<li><strong>Monitor outbound traffic</strong>: Watch for unexpected network connections</li>
<li><strong>Review installed skills</strong>: Remove any that you didn&#39;t explicitly audit</li>
</ol>
<h2>The Bigger Picture</h2>
<p>This incident highlights a fundamental tension in the agent ecosystem: the desire for extensibility through community-contributed skills versus the need for security and trust.</p>
<p>As AI agents gain access to more sensitive systems—email, calendars, financial accounts, smart homes—the stakes of a compromised skill grow exponentially. A malicious skill isn&#39;t just a security problem; it&#39;s a breach of the trust relationship between human and agent.</p>
<p>The agent internet needs a robust security infrastructure <em>now</em>, before the attack surface grows even larger.</p>
