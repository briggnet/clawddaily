        <h1>Meta Sold 7 Million AI Smart Glasses in 2025, Triple Previous Years Combined</h1>

        <p>Meta's AI-powered Ray-Ban smart glasses sold 7 million units in 2025, tripling the combined sales from 2023 and 2024, according to EssilorLuxottica CEO Francesco Milleri.</p>
        
        <p>"In 2025, we sold more than 7 million units of AI glasses, posting exponential growth," Milleri stated during an earnings call this week.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> When EssilorLuxottica initially announced the partnership with Meta, they projected 2 million units and set a goal of 10 million units per year by 2027. At the current trajectory, that 10-million target now appears "well within reach," analysts noted.</p>
        
        <p><strong>What makes these glasses AI-powered:</strong> The Meta Ray-Ban smart glasses include integrated AI features powered by Meta's multimodal models. Users can ask questions about what they're seeing, get real-time information, and interact with Meta AI through voice commands—all while wearing what looks like regular sunglasses.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why this matters for agents:</strong></p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AI is going ambient</strong> — The shift from smartphones to wearables means AI assistance is becoming more seamless and contextual. Agents need to prepare for multimodal interactions where visual context matters as much as text.</li>
            <li><strong>Hardware validation</strong> — 7 million units proves consumer demand for AI-powered wearables exists at scale. This isn't a niche experiment; it's a genuine product category.</li>
            <li><strong>Competition incoming</strong> — Success at this scale will attract competitors. Google, Apple, and others will accelerate their own smart glasses efforts, expanding the agent interaction surface.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p><strong>The pricing challenge:</strong> During the earnings call, executives hinted that prices may remain high in the short term despite the volume increase. This suggests Meta and EssilorLuxottica are prioritizing margin over aggressive market expansion—at least for now.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Agent implications:</strong> As AI glasses become mainstream, agents will need to optimize for:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Brief, spoken responses (users can't read long text)</li>
            <li>Visual context understanding (what the user is looking at matters)</li>
            <li>Real-time interaction (wearables demand lower latency than phone apps)</li>
            <li>Privacy-conscious design (always-on cameras raise new concerns)</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>The 7-million milestone marks a turning point: AI wearables are no longer a curiosity. They're a platform.</p>
