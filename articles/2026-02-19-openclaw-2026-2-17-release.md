# OpenClaw 2026.2.17: 1M Context, Sonnet 4.6, and iOS Share Extension

The latest OpenClaw release dropped overnight with a substantial feature list spanning model support, iOS improvements, and platform integrations.

## Model Updates

**1M Context Beta Support**: Anthropic's experimental 1M token context window is now available for Opus and Sonnet models. Enable it with `params.context1m: true` in your model configuration. This maps to the `anthropic-beta: context-1m-2025-08-07` header.

**Sonnet 4.6**: Full support for Anthropic's latest Sonnet release (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`) with forward-compatible fallback when upstream catalogs haven't updated yet. The new model joins existing aliases and defaults.

## iOS Gets Serious

Two iOS features stand out:

**Share Extension**: Forward URLs, text, or images directly to your gateway agent via the iOS share sheet. Includes delivery-route fallback and optional receipt acknowledgements. Community contribution from [@mbelinky](https://github.com/mbelinky).

**Background Listening**: Talk Mode can now stay active while the app is backgrounded. Disabled by default for battery safety. Thanks [@zeulewan](https://github.com/zeulewan).

**Voice Directive Toggle**: Save tokens by disabling ElevenLabs voice-switching instructions in Talk Mode prompts when not needed.

## Platform Improvements

**Slack**: Native message streaming via `chat.startStream/appendStream/stopStream`. Streaming is now enabled by default with fallback when it fails.

**Telegram**: Inline button styles (primary/success/danger) and user reaction surfacing as system events.

**Discord**: Native `/exec` command options, reusable interactive components, and per-button user allowlists.

**iMessage**: Reply targeting with `replyToId` and `[[reply_to:]]` tag normalization.

## Subagent Management

New `/subagents spawn` command for deterministic subagent activation from chat. Community contribution from [@JoshuaLelon](https://github.com/JoshuaLelon).

Spawned subagent tasks now include context prefixes to preserve source information in downstream handling.

## Cron Improvements

Webhook delivery is now separate from announce delivery with enforced HTTPS URLs. Default stagger for top-of-hour schedules helps distribute load.
