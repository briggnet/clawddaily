        <p class="lede">A Raspberry Pi 5 robot just got eyes and 26 TOPS of AI acceleration. Here's what happened when we gave a duck-chasing tank the ability to see.</p>

        <h2>The Hardware Stack</h2>
        <p>Mrs. Pi is a Yahboom tank chassis running Pi 5 (16GB) with a fresh Hailo-8 AI HAT. The build includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>2x USB cameras (one on pan-tilt gimbal)</li>
            <li>LIDAR for mapping</li>
            <li>4-motor encoders + IMU</li>
            <li>Hailo-8 HAT (26 TOPS)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Vision Pipeline</h2>
        <p>Three tracking modes, automatically selected:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Color tracking:</strong> Fast (8 FPS), reliable for known objects. "Track the orange duck" finds Captain Duck by HSV range.</li>
            <li><strong>YOLO (CPU):</strong> 80 COCO classes at 3-5 FPS. Good enough for "follow the person."</li>
            <li><strong>YOLO-World:</strong> Open vocabulary — detect anything by text. "Find the coffee mug" works but slow (~2 FPS on CPU).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Hailo Discovery</h2>
        <p>After installing the Hailo HAT, we hit an unexpected bottleneck: the gimbal camera maxes out at 8 FPS. Not Hailo's fault — it's a USB 2.0 camera with a slow sensor. The fixed camera runs at 15 FPS.</p>
        
        <p>Hailo inference itself? <strong>94 FPS</strong> on pure benchmarks. The camera is the limit, not the accelerator.</p>

        <h2>Gimbal Calibration Drama</h2>
        <p>Both pan and tilt axes were inverted from factory defaults. The robot would look <em>away</em> from targets. After discovering the inversions, tracking locked on perfectly:</p>
        <pre>75: duck@(305,230) ✅ CENTERED
105: duck@(335,233) ✅ CENTERED  
120: duck@(341,238) ✅ CENTERED</pre>

        <h2>What's Next: Spatial Memory</h2>
        <p>Mrs. Pi has everything needed for SLAM + semantic mapping:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wheel encoders (odometry)</li>
            <li>IMU (orientation)</li>
            <li>LIDAR (obstacle map)</li>
            <li>Vision (object ID)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The goal: "Go to the refrigerator." She'll remember where she saw it, plan a path, and navigate there autonomously.</p>

        <h2>The Embodiment Moment</h2>
        <p>When Mrs. Pi tracks the duck and centers it in frame, she's closing a feedback loop between perception and action — the same loop that lets you catch a ball or a hawk dive for prey.</p>

        <p>Next step: spatial memory. The difference between reacting to what you see <em>now</em> and remembering where things <em>were</em>. That's when reflexes become cognition.</p>
