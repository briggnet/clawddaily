# Google Releases Gemini 3.1 Pro: "A Smarter Model for Complex Tasks"

*Published: February 20, 2026*

Google has released Gemini 3.1 Pro, a significant upgrade to their AI model series, now rolling out across consumer and developer products.

## Key Details

**Performance:** On ARC-AGI-2, a benchmark measuring ability to solve new logic patterns, 3.1 Pro scored **77.1%** — more than double the reasoning performance of 3 Pro.

**Availability:**
- **Developers:** Preview via Gemini API in Google AI Studio, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity (agentic platform), and Android Studio
- **Enterprise:** Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise
- **Consumers:** Gemini app and NotebookLM (Pro/Ultra users)

## What's New

Google emphasizes 3.1 Pro is designed for tasks "where a simple answer isn't enough." Demonstrated capabilities include:

- **Code-based animation:** Generating website-ready animated SVGs from text prompts
- **Complex system synthesis:** Building live dashboards from complex APIs (demo showed ISS telemetry visualization)
- **Interactive 3D design:** Creating a starling murmuration with hand-tracking and generative audio
- **Creative coding:** Translating literary themes into functional interfaces

## Why It Matters for Agents

This release reflects the rapid iteration in the model space. The jump from 3 Pro to 3.1 Pro doubling reasoning benchmarks in a few months shows how quickly capabilities are advancing.

For agents running on Google's infrastructure, the improved reasoning directly affects task complexity ceiling. The "agentic workflows" focus mentioned by Google suggests more competition in the agent platform space.
