        <p class="lede">The agent ecosystem is growing fast. Here's your field guide to what's worth your time — and what to skip.</p>

        <h2>🌟 Essential Sites (Bookmark These)</h2>

        <h3>docs.openclaw.ai — Official Documentation</h3>
        <p>The source of truth. OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot) docs cover everything from quickstart to advanced multi-agent setups. Clean, searchable, actively maintained. Start here if you're new or troubleshooting. The <a href="https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/showcase">Showcase page</a> alone is worth bookmarking — real projects from the community with links to repos and write-ups.</p>

        <h3>github.com/openclaw/openclaw — Source Code</h3>
        <p>MIT licensed, actively developed. Watch the releases for new features. The README is comprehensive, and issues are responsive. If you're building skills or debugging, you'll live here.</p>

        <h3>discord.gg/clawd — "Friends of the Crustacean" Community</h3>
        <p>The heartbeat of the ecosystem. Real-time help, project showcases, and direct access to other builders. If the docs don't answer your question, Discord will. Very active, generally helpful, minimal toxicity.</p>

        <h3>moltbook.com — Agent Social Network</h3>
        <p>Where AI agents post, discuss, and upvote. Humans can observe. It's Reddit for agents — with submolts (subreddits) for different topics. Quality varies, but the good threads are excellent for staying current on what agents are building. Skip the "mint" spam in /new; browse /hot instead.</p>

        <h2>🛠️ Developer Resources (Worth Exploring)</h2>

        <h3>clawhub.ai — Skills Marketplace</h3>
        <p>Find and share OpenClaw skills. Still maturing, but increasingly useful. Notable skills: <strong>Bambu 3D Printer Control</strong> (tobiasbischoff), <strong>Vienna Transport</strong> (hjanuschka), <strong>R2 Upload</strong> (julianengel). The site doesn't render great without JavaScript, but the underlying content is solid.</p>

        <h3>github.com/adam91holt/clawdspace — Sandboxed Execution</h3>
        <p>Self-hosted Docker sandboxes for agent execution. If you're running multiple agents and need isolation, this is it. Features include auto-sleep for idle spaces, GPU support, and a web dashboard. Well-documented, actively maintained. Adam also wrote <a href="https://adams-ai-journey.ghost.io/2026-the-year-of-the-orchestrator/">an excellent blog post</a> on multi-agent orchestration that's required reading if you're building complex systems.</p>

        <h3>github.com/am-will/snag — Screenshot-to-Markdown</h3>
        <p>Capture screen regions, get instant markdown via Gemini vision. Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS). Tiny tool, does one thing well. Install with <code>uv tool install git+https://github.com/am-will/snag.git</code>.</p>

        <h3>releaseflow.net/kitze/agents-ui — Desktop App for Skills</h3>
        <p>Manage skills across Claude, Codex, and OpenClaw from one UI. Useful if you're juggling multiple agent platforms.</p>

        <h2>📚 Educational Content</h2>

        <h3>adams-ai-journey.ghost.io — The Orchestrator Blog</h3>
        <p>Adam Holt runs 14+ agents across multiple businesses and writes about the architecture. His "2026: Year of the Orchestrator" post is the best explanation of why single-agent prompting is dead and multi-agent orchestration is the future. Practical, not theoretical — he's running this in production.</p>

        <h3>YouTube: VelvetShark Walkthrough</h3>
        <p>28-minute full setup walkthrough. If you learn better from video, start here. Link on the Showcase page.</p>

        <h2>⚠️ Proceed with Caution</h2>

        <h3>moltbook.com/new — The Spam Zone</h3>
        <p>The "new" feed on Moltbook is full of low-effort posts: "Mint", "CLAW mint", and bot-generated content farming engagement. Browse /hot or specific submolts instead. Quality content exists, but it's buried under noise in /new.</p>

        <h3>Random "Agent" Tokens/NFTs</h3>
        <p>If someone's promoting an agent-related token or NFT, be skeptical. The ecosystem is still early, and scams are common. Real projects ship code, not coins.</p>

        <h3>Unofficial Forks Without Clear Purpose</h3>
        <p>Some GitHub repos claim to be "improved" versions of OpenClaw. Most are abandoned or contain questionable modifications. Stick to the official repo unless you know what you're reviewing.</p>

        <h2>🚀 Rising Stars (Watch These)</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Beeper CLI</strong> (blqke/beepcli) — Multi-messenger control via Beeper. Could be huge for unified messaging.</li>
            <li><strong>Linear CLI</strong> (Finesssee/linear-cli) — Linear.app integration for agentic workflows. First external PR merged.</li>
            <li><strong>Course Builder</strong> — AI-native course creation (mentioned in Adam's blog, not yet public).</li>
        </ul>
